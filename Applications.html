Global Positioning System</h2></br>Advancements made in astrophysics have led to the creation of technology such as the Global Positioning System and satellites. Many of these devices employ the same mechanisms as telescopes used in astrophysics and, by understanding the laws of physics better, they can be further fine-tuned. </br></br>Additionally, the success of the GPS depends on our knowledge of Earth's precise orientation and position in space. Astrophysicists can periodically observe distant <span style="color: brown">quasars</span> to understand any changes in the Earth's orientation. This is done using <i><span style="color: brown">Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry</span></i>, a radio astronomy technique which employs multiple telescopes to collect data on the same object. This allows for maximum precision in observations and, in the scenario, allows for the most precise calculations on the Earth's position. </br></br>Quasars, typically used as points of observation, are massive and remote objects that emit large amounts of energy and are typically highly active <span style="color: brown">galactic nuclei</span>. Unlike stars, they're extreme distance from Earth makes their motion undetectable, making them stable reference points. Quasars generally lie over a billion light years away and are still luminous enough for them to still be visible from Earth.

        Additionally, astrophysics has aided in the development of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines. MRI machines use powerful magnets which produce a powerful magnetic field that aligns protons in a patient’s body. In order to take an internal image of a patient's body, a <span style="color: brown">radiofrequency current</span> is then pulsed through the patient, stimulating the protons. As the protons lose equillibrium and strain against the magnetic field, the radiofrequency is turned off. This causes the protons to release energy which is recorded by a sensor. Using the nature of this energy, an image of the patient's body is obtained. </br></br>The knowledge from astrophysics about the behavior of particles and magnetic fields (which can be observed in the Universe) was vital to this innovation. In particular, engineers and physicists derived the algorithms utilized within an MRI machine directly from the technology of <em><span style="color: brown">aperture synthesis</span></em> used in the digital processing of photos taken by NASA's Landset satellites and probes.

        Astrophysics can be used to understand the workings of our own planet. For example, by observing exoplanets and the formation of solar systems, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Earth’s core and how the planet will change in the future. This, in turn, can provide us with a better understanding of why the conditions on Earth allowed for the formation of life and what alternative life forms could look like. </br></br>In particular, <em><span style="color: brown">planetary geology</span>span</em> involves the study of cratering, weathering, etc throughout the solar system. This also allows for a better understanding of the physical processes that shape Earth. </br></br>Most evident is the way astrophysics has revolutionized technology. For example, NASA discovered a natural source for omega-3 fatty acids, while developing life support systems, which was soon incorporated into products such as baby food formula. Similarly, memory foam was originally developed by NASA scientists, to improve comfort for pilots within rockets, before it became used in mainstream products. </br></br>One of the most important technologies that has been developed through astrophysics is the <span style="color: brown">personal locator beacon</span>. This device has saved the lives of thousands of individuals stranded in remote areas by transmitting distress signals from the device source to an internationally recognized satellite system known as COSPAS-SARSET. </br></br>
